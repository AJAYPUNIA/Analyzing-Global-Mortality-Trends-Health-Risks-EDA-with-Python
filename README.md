# Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Dataset

👋 Hi! This is my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project where I analyzed real-world health data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study.

## 📌 Project Goal
The main goal was to understand:
- What are the top causes of death around the world?
- Are deaths increasing or decreasing over time?
- Which countries have the highest death rates?
- What are the major risk factors (like smoking, pollution, etc.)?
- How do death rates differ between males and females?
- How are risk factors related to death numbers?

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Heart disease and stroke are top causes of death globally.
- Males usually have higher death rates than females.
- Pollution, poor diet, and infections are some of the biggest health risks.
- People are living longer, and Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) is improving.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools I Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data cleaning and merging
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for creating graphs and charts
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for writing and visualizing code
- **EDA techniques** – like grouping, filtering, and visualization

## 📊 Visualizations I Created
- Bar Charts – for top causes of death and risk factors
- Line Charts – for trends over time
- Box Plots – to compare males and females
- Heatmaps – to show relationship between risk and death

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is based on the **Global Burden of Disease (GBD)** – a public dataset that covers mortality, health risks, and life expectancy.

## 🎓 Course Project
This project was completed for my **Exploratory Data Analysis** course at **Montclair State University**. I also gave a class presentation using this analysis.
